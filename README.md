# Remnant 2: Armor Calculator
A `.html` file that helps calculate the highest armor value you can achieve at a specific weight. Calculations are performed in javascript.

>**NOTE:** This calculator currently only contains the Armor sets that are available at launch. If I'm still playing Remnant II at the time of any additional armor sets being released, I will update the calculator.

## Why?

If you are familiar with how Remnant II's armor system works, weight is directly related to your character’s Speed and Stamina. Each armor has a certain Weight number, and you will receive a stamina cost penalty if the total Weight value exceeds a certain threshold. Generally, you want to keep your character as light as possible without sacrificing your defense. The thresholds are as follows:

* **Light:** <=25 – You receive no Stamina Cost Penalty and can perform fast dodges.
* **Normal:** 26-50 – You get 25 percent of the Stamina Cost Penalty and can dodge normally.
* **Heavy:** 51-75 – You gain 50 percent of the Stamina Cost Penalty, and your Speed is much slower.
* **Overweight:** >=76 – You suffer 75 percent of the Stamina Cost Penalty. You cannot dodge and can only perform belly flops.

## Usage
1. Download the `remnant-armor-calculator.html` file, which you can run locally on your machine in a web browser. 
2. Enter a "Weight" target in the input field and click "Update" 
3. The tool should show sets of Armors that will get you the highest armor for the weight specified.
